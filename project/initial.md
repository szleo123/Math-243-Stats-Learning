##Hien’s ideas
 
1.I can't be the only one who doesn't like my Discover Weekly playlist, curated and released every Monday by Spotify. Very boldly, Spotify introduces new songs that they think I will like based on my current playlist. Though I have not been wowed by Spotify's consitent attempts to predict my music taste, I'm intrigued by how they make my Discover Weekly playlist, so I can make one myself that's (hopefully) better. But how do I know if I'd like a song or not, without having ever listened to it? Turns out, the acoustic features of a song play a big role in deciding whether I will like the song or not. The question is: What acoustic features contribute the most in defining my music taste? Can I predict my new favorite song based on my current playlist?

Goal: Classification. Inference + Prediction. Using the Spotify API, we will train our model with songs from our favorite playlist, and songs that we dislike.
 
2.Can we build a model to detect users at risk of depression from their social media posts?

Goal: Classification. Predictive. We will train a model to predict signs of depression or PTSD from users' tweets using data from the CLPsych 2015 Shared Task*. The project idea is based on this project from the University of Pennsylvania.

* The dataset contains sensitive information so a confidentiality agreement has to be signed in order for the dataset to be obtained.
 
3.What is the chance of survival of a character from the well-known American TV show Game of Thrones based on what we know about the history of battles between the character's affiliated side and their enemies?

Goal: Regression. Predictive. We will train a model to predict a character's chance of survival from this Kaggle dataset and compare the results to the book events.

Can GSS data, such as income, gender, education, party affiliation, race, etc., predict the likelihood that someone voted? Regression
Can GSS data, such as above, predict someone’s views on gender roles (ex. Role variable “girls should act like girls”)? Classification (group responses into agree, disagree, neutral)
Can GSS data predict someone’s views on abortion? Classification (group responses into pro-choice, pro-life, neutral)

##YILIN’s idea

The MNIST database of handwritten digits is a classic dataset for machine learning learners. Can we build up classification models to recognize what the digit(0-9) is in a given image based on 60,000 training images. The idea is mainly from Yann LeCun, NYU. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ They provided the results from numerous models with corresponding papers, which could be good references for us.
