### Chapter 2 exercises

#### Exercise 1
a) better. With an extremely large sample set, we can fit a really good flexible model more close to the data. 

b) worse. A flexible model will overfit such small sample. 

c) better. A flexible model will fit better in more complicated relations.

d) worse. A flexible model will also fit the noise term into the model and increase the total error. 

#### Exercise 2
a) regression. inference. n = '500 firms in the US'; p = 3 'profit, number of employees, industry'.

b) classification. prediction. n = '20 similar products'; p = 13 'price charged, marketing budget, comp. price, ten other variables'

c) regression. prediction. n = 52 ' weekly data for all of 2012'; p = 3 '%change in the US market, the % change in the British market,and the % change in the German market.'

#### Exercise 4
a) 1. picture recognition. responses are 'cat, dog, pig...'. predictors are features extracted from the pictures. It's for inference. 
   2. disease diagnose. responses are 'have disease/not have disease'. predictors are indicators of body inspection. It's for inference. 
   3. whether give the applier insurance. responses are 'give/don't give'. predictors are living area, parents, economic situation. It's an inference. 

b) 1. predict the house price. responses are house prices. predictors are size of the house, surrounding facilities, years of the house. It's a prediction 
   2. final score prediction. responses are scores. predictors are time of studying per week, concentration on the exam, mood. It's a prediction 
   3. next year's salary predict. responses are salary numbers. predictors are occupations, working time per week. It's a prediction. 

c) 1. recommending system. recommend customers products liked by similar customers.
   2. illness classification. judge different type of illness.
   3. ethics classification. classify different ethics with similar characteristics. 
   
#### Exercise 5
advantages: more close to the true relationship. better prediction results
disadvantages: more tending to be overfitting. need to fit a lot of parameters 

When we need to predict something and a lot of data, we prefer a more flexible approach to get a better prediction result. When we need to make an inference to explain something, we prefer to use a less flexible approach to avoid high variance.

#### Exercise 6 
parametric model: pre-set a set of parameters to fit from data
non-parametric model: does not require a function form. fit with data directly.

advantages of parametric models: not too many parameters to fit. less data needed compared to non-parametric models
disadvantages of parametric models: those parameters might not really reflect the true relation and some of the parameters could be redundant to fit.
