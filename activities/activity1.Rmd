#### Q1

It's a linear regression of logorithm of the price using logorithm of sqft, bed and city three predictors. The geometry is 3 parallel planes in 3 dimension.

#### Q2

```{r}
m1 = lm(log(price)~log(sqft) + bed + city, data = LA)
summary(m1)
```

The reference level is Beverly Hills. 

#### Q3 

The negative sign of bed means that holding the size of the house and the city the same, the house will be more expensive with less beds. 

#### Interactions

```{r}
m2 = lm(log(price)~log(sqft) + bed + city + log(sqft):city, data = LA)
summary(m2)
```

The geometry of this is 4 planes with tilted slopes. 

#### Interactions 2

```{r}
m3 = lm(log(price)~log(sqft) + bed + log(sqft):bed, data = LA)
summary(m3)
```
